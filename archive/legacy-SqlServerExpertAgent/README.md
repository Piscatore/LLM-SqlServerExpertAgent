## Migration to RAID Platform

These legacy components have been restructured and integrated into the RAID Platform:

### Old â†’ New Mapping
| Legacy Component | RAID Platform Location |
|-----------------|-------------------------|
| SqlServerExpertAgent.Core | `src/Agents/Raid.Agents.Database/Raid.Agents.Database.Core/` |
| SqlServerExpertAgent.Console | `src/Agents/Raid.Agents.Database/Raid.Agents.Database.Console/` |
| SqlServerExpertAgent.Tests | `tests/Raid.Agents.Database.Tests/` |
| SqlServerExpertAgent.sln | `RaidPlatform.sln` |

The RAID Platform provides:
- Enhanced architecture with Infrastructure Agents (Memory, Security, Orchestrator, Analytics)
- Professional project organization
- Scalable agent ecosystem
- Cross-agent communication capabilities
- Modern .NET 9 implementations
