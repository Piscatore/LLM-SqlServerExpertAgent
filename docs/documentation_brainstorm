# Preface
There are too many poorly documented frameworks out there, let's not make this one of them. Heres my spontainious thoughts on what we need, except for the internal development documents. The thoughts here are for the productification of it. Actual implementation that we need to use ourselves are left a side here.
## Sales pitch document. 
Short "sales" copy to explain what this is, what you can do and what the usp's is. Product naming should be descided first. Actually there could be a complete productification meeting needed first. Is this a single product or is it a bundle of smaller products?
## Installation. 
Important. Do not leave out things because they could considered to be obvious. 
## Minimal setup. 
Quick start guide. Doesnt mean the instructions are minimal. "Anyone" should be able to follow rhese instructions but it is only a simplified setup.
##Reference guide
All facts in one place for lookups.
## User Manual
Comprehensive usage manual with examples
## Cource material
Deep knowledge book with exercises and deep insight education. Also covering introduction to "standards" related to LLM programming and agentical designs and patterns. (Do outline and Plan for future)
