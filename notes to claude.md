Working off line here.
2025-08-13 22:07. Interrupted at 5 hour limit again - need to implement transactional work to avoid things beeing half made? A hook that triggers close to "out of token" so work can be committed and status and context properly saved would be perfect. Now add that to todo's or find a matching Life project to include this - or - make a new project for it if needed
Go on and complete the single SQL Server expert agent we are working on.
Prepair and refactor (if needed) for multi agent hybrid implementations via suitable framework (agent-protocol looks right). 
Split the git skills into separate agent(s) according to your hybrid model - when it is most suitable to do so.
Best way to reuse code in the current single agent within in others? Separate common denominators from specialisations? Use a "plugin" interface for speciallisations (the skills???). How much can be achived with configuration (declarativity)
About providing agents with the infrastructure they need: Like the SQL Server Expert will need actual SQL Server instances. Should ve use fixed roles of server instances? For example, for different staging levels, private dev/sandbox, shared dev, Different levels of testing stages. System integrations, acceptans, pre production etc. OR should instancification be completely ad-hoc depending on current need?
Container management seems very usefull.  A container management agent? Or perhaps a fully fledged IT Manager / CTO? That can provide things like virtual servers, networks, firewalls etc?
How about docker prerequisites if docker is 2 b used for container management.
what about MCP? It wouldn't be very awkward to publish an agent as a MCP Server, would it? How to look upon this in an upscaled environment MCP to Agent 1:1? Or one MCP to the whole "team" of agents.
Agent to agent communication: Could we have a chat forum agent or plugin? A redit or stackoverflow room for AI's? Global vs team internal?
Can we have LLM model Agnosticity? Perhaps via a specialized LLM manager agent? Could we get dynamic management of subscriptions, token preservation, model selection. Why use the most expencive model for quick and dirty experiments, prototyping or proof of concepts? Dynamicly swithch to the most competent model on-demand?
Memory - this seems to be an imprtant concideration. Easy access to different types of memory needs to implemented. Private memory, shared memory.Globaly (cloud) accassable, local - in one dimension and procedural, semantic, episodic etc in apperaing in all of the above contexts.
About our current collab scheme, make sure that when local CLAUDE.md files are created in a project context it includes instructions to read global memory as well. For all current projects in the project catalog check each CLAUDE.md to see if it is there. If not add tha instruction to read global memory (IF not allready done). We can now start a session and start a context and all memory, both global and local is "connected" - no more alzhimer llm (bad joke)
When switching or starting up a context / project, can we infer a change of directory for claude and also for the ide to open the correct solution / folder /workspace? I have noticed that when I forgot to change current directory but switched project context, the old conversations were not found when i started claude later in the correct folder the next time. The permission granting also appeared lost (or rather stored in the wrong folder)
Is there a best practice to enable the llm (or agents) to do longer continous work autonomously? With good specifications and planning and an esablished workflow it aught to be possible to press start and come back to a complete tested, documented and deployed application...
Thought: Emagine a team of virtual planning agents, Architects, UI/UX experts, project managers, financial managers, client communication experts, documentation masters etc that could cooperate to do extremley accurate specifications, models and plans. Perhaps prototyping and iterating that phase. Then a handover to a fully fledged autonomous production team of agents etc....
